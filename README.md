TibCoin is a didactic blockchain network, based on the original Bitcoin whitepaper. The goal is to simulate a working blockchain network, on multiple computers and to provide tools 
to visualize its inner workings. With that goal a complex GUI was created using ImGUI. Boost.Asio was used for the network conenctions,and low-level I/O.
